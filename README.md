I only had problems when attempting to code something in Javascript I had not tried to code before. The hardest part was the fade transistions on the homepage, but thankfully I managed to solve it. 

The resources I used on this project were:

This was the tutorial I used to create the basis for the slideshow on the homepage and the about page

I utilized W3 schools constantly to double check my coding work. In this case I also used it to teach myself about elements I was unfamiliar with but wanted to implement, such as a drop down list. I also used this to double check border-radii, teach myself about setTimeout, and also to teach myself about onchange events.

Css tricks is always my go too to find little short cuts. I used it to both check object-fit and different aspects of flexbox. I also used it to make the little triangles in the buttons on the homepage.
